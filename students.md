## Academany Structure

**Classes**

**Global Lecture / Class**
During the class, faculty presents and explains the content of each week’s assignment 


**Local Instruction**
During the week, students will work in the Lab, with their peers and under the guidance of their Instructor, to accomplish the weekly assignments. Every Node must ensure:

- Instruction and technical guidance to all students

- Students support off hours

- Students weekly evaluation

- Archive management (setting and fixing student’s sites on GitLab)


### Evaluation & Examination

The evaluation process to assess student’s progress on assignments during the cycle is comprised by 2 layers:

> Local evaluation

> Global evaluation

 Evaluation Criteria or Assessment Standards are updated yearly. 


### Graduation

Fab Lab community gathers in an annual Conference in a different city around the world. During these events, we organize the **Graduation of Academany Students**.

These events typically take place the last week of July or the first week of August, and Graduates have a free entrance ticket. More information closer to the event.
