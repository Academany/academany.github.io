## Applications and implications of synthetic biology

Bio Academy Program is a 6-month program where students learn the applications and implications of synthetic biology. Its first version started when Harvard Professor George Church made a variant on the Fab Academy curriculum, focussing on How to Grow (almost) Anything instead of the How to Make course.

Classes included DNA nanostructures, CRISPR-CAS9, FISSEQ, open source hardware for Bio Labs, 3D bioprinting, synthetic minimal cells and much more.

This course ran in a Distributed (through out more than +10 Labs around the world) way for 4 years, from 2015 to 2018, and currently runs locally at MIT: [MAS.S61- How To Grow (Almost) Anything](https://www.media.mit.edu/courses/htgaa/)

**We’re preparing a new version of Distributed Bio Academy...more info soon!**

> George Church is Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and Director of PersonalGenomes.org, which provides the world’s only open-access information on human Genomic, Environmental & Trait data (GET).
