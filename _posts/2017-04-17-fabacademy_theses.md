### The next step after Fab Academy

The Fab Academy Applied Research Program (FAB-ARP) will provide the means and infrastructure for the development of research projects inside the existing Fab Lab Network. Designed as for Academany Graduates, the program aims to offer students the possibility to continue their research interests initiated from the technical curriculum offered in the different classes along the year..

The projects will be oriented towards the development of advanced digital fabrication techniques and strategies in order to level up the existing practices, as well as the implementation of local solutions for existing needs in the Fab Lab context.


### More information

This program is also aimed at:

- Bachelor’s or higher degree in any design or engineering degree with Digital Fabrication and/or programming experience
- Professionals with ITC, Biology, Engineering, Design, among other application interests

The program will be held in Fab Labs alongside the existing Academany courses, and will be supported by certified instructors with previous qualifications in digital fabrication.

The program starts in September and conclude in June. Participating students must deliver a written thesis paper describing and documenting all the processes followed to accomplish the research goals. All projects should be practical, both represented on physical working prototypes and products, and in applied fields of implementation.

Thesis projects will be reviewed by the evaluation team, which will be formed by, student’s advisor, Fab Academy scientific committee members and invited guest jury. Projects will be validated locally, and should be well documented through the online platform at the Fab Academy archive.

Projects will then be taken further by the scientific committee, taking in consideration distribution and commercialization strategies.
