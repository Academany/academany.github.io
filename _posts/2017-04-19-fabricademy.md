The intersection between textiles, digital fabrication and biology

___

## Fabricademy: a new Textile Academy

**A transdisciplinary course that focuses on the development of new technologies applied in the textile industry, in its broad range of applications, from the fashion industry and the upcoming wearable market.**

This two phase program will last 6 months, with approximately 3 months of seminars and learning modules and three months focusing on individual in depth applied project research.

The fashion industry is one of the most traditional and the 2nd most polluting in the world after oil. The production of the clothes we use is sustained over devastating social consequences in countries like Bangladesh and China, where labour exploitation holds the low prices we love to pay in fast fashion brands. The program will focus on the unethical and environmentally unfriendly realities of the current industry, while combining the knowledge of traditional and future craftsmanship to work towards new ways of designing, prototyping and producing for the slowly changing textile and fashion-industry.

The possibilities to conduct experimental research in a open laboratory gives the physical and mental space for innovative re-thinking and reframing of todays realities, offering the resources for visions to be materialised, tested, developed and make an active impact in peopleâ€™s life, no as a linear process, but as a spiral iteration and implementation in the reality.

Through the program, we are developing and implementing a new approach on how to create, produce and distribute textile and fashion elements, by using distributed manufacturing infrastructures and knowledge networks. Along with experts from the field, the participants will investigate how the textile and fashion industry can benefit from new technologies, processes and business models.

> This program was created and is run by Anastasia Pistofidou, Cecilia Raspanti & Fiore Basile.
