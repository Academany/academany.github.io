## Why to make (Almost) Anything

Acclaimed artist Olafur Eliasson is working with the Academany on projects and programs that focus on the WHY of making instead of giving people command of the tools for making or growing (almost) anything.

This will consist of a series of lectures, programs and projects all revolving around the subject of Why to Make.

### Faculty  

Born in 1967, Olafur Eliasson grew up in Iceland and Denmark and studied from 1989 to
1995 at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. In 1995, he founded his Berlin studio, which
today encompasses approximately ninety craftsmen, specialised technicians, architects,
archivists, administrators, programmers, art historians, and cooks. In addition to realising
artworks in-house, the studio contracts with structural engineers and other specialists and
collaborates worldwide with cultural practitioners, policy makers, and scientists.
