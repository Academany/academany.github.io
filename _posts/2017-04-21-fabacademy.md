Applications and implications of Digital Fabrication


___

## Prototype your ideas into products


**Fab Academy is an intensive ﬁve-month program that teaches students to envision, design and prototype projects using digital fabrication tools and machines. It is a multi-disciplinary and hands-on learning experience that empowers students to learn-by-doing and inspires them to make stuff locally to become active participants in sustainable cities and communities.**

At the Fab Academy, you will learn how to envision, prototype and document your ideas through many hours of hands-on experience with digital fabrication tools. We take a variety of code formats and turn them into physical objects. The Fab Diploma is the result of the sum of Fab Academy Certificates. Progress towards the diploma is evaluated by a student’s acquired skills rather than time or credits.

The Fab Academy is a fast paced, hands-on learning experience where students plan and execute a new project each week! Each individual documents their progress for each project, resulting in a personal portfolio of technical accomplishments

> Fab Academy is a Digital Fabrication programme directed by Neil Gershenfeld of MIT’s [Center For Bits and Atoms](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/) and based on MIT’s rapid prototyping course: [How to Make (Almost) Anything](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.19/).
